\section{Spinor-helicity formalism}
The spinor-helicity formalism is widely used in amplitude literatures. 
One can refer to~\cite{Dixon:1996wi,Elvang:2013cua} for good introductions\footnote{The convention may change according to the signature}.
We present some useful properties under the convention used in QCD~\cite{Dixon:1996wi}.

In a gauge theory, one might want to write the kinematic part of amplitudes in terms of the Lorentz invariants that can be formed from external momenta, \eg the square $p^2$ of a four-vector $p^\mu$.
However, in most interesting models, there are not only scalar fields but also particles which have spins. 
A more suitable representation of the Lorentz group is the spinor two-dimensional spinor representation.
We can trade a four-dimensional vector for a pair of spinors.
To be more explicit, let us consider the massless case.
Consider two spinors $\bar{u}(p)$ and $v(p)$ for an outgoing fermion and an outgoing anti-fermion of momentum $p$.
They satisfy the Dirac equation and we can decompose them into two parts of different helicity:
\begin{equation*}
v_+(p) = \begin{pmatrix}
|p]_\alpha \\ 0
\end{pmatrix} := \lambda_p^\alpha
\quad,\quad
v_-(p) = \begin{pmatrix}
0 \\ |p\rangle^{\dot{\alpha}}
\end{pmatrix} := \tilde{\lambda}_p^{\dot{\alpha}}
\quad,\quad
\bar{u}_-(p) = \begin{pmatrix} 
0, & \langle p |_{\dot{\alpha}})\end{pmatrix}
\quad,\quad
\bar{u}_+(p) = \begin{pmatrix} [ p|^\alpha, & 0 \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation*} 
where $v_\pm = \frac{1}{2}(1\pm\gamma_5)v(p)$ (analog for the others) and $\alpha = 1,2$.
The crossing symmetry is garanteed since $v_\pm = u_\mp$.
Using the Dirac representation for the gamma matrices, 
we have
\begin{equation*}
\slashed{p} = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & p_{a\dot{b}} \\ 
p^{\dot{a}b} & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation*}
where 
\begin{equation*}
p^{\dot{a}b} = p_\mu(\bar{\sigma^\mu})^{\dot{a}b}
\quad,\quad
p_{a\dot{b}} = p_\mu(\sigma^\mu)_{a\dot{b}}
\end{equation*}
With a slight abuse of notation, the massless Dirac equation implies
\begin{equation*}
\slashed{p}v_\pm (p) = \slashed{p}|p^\pm\rangle = 0
\quad \mathrm{where}\quad
|p^+\rangle := |p]
\quad
|p^-\rangle := |p\rangle
\end{equation*}
The raising and lowering of spinor indices are achieved by the Levi-Civita tensor
\begin{equation*}
[p|^a = \epsilon^{ab}|p] \quad,\quad
|p\rangle^{\dot{a}} = \epsilon^{\dot{a}\dot{b}}\langle p |_{\dot{b}}
\end{equation*}
The spinor products defined in the following are Lorentz invariant objects
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
& \langle ij \rangle = \epsilon^{ab}(\lambda_i)_a(\lambda_j)_b = \bar{u}_-(i)u_+(j)
\\
& [ij] = \epsilon^{\dot{a}\dot{b}}(\tilde{\lambda}_i)_{\dot{a}}(\tilde{\lambda}_j)_{\dot{b}} = \bar{u}_+(i)u_-(j)
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
In this formalism, the momentum can also be chosen complex. 
In the case where the momentum is real, we note that
$(\slashed{p})^* = {}^t\slashed{p}$, which correspond to an exchange of the right and the left spinors. 
In other words, the chirality flip of all spinors in a spinor product is simply the complex conjugate of teh spinor product
\begin{equation*}
[ij] = \langle ij \rangle^* \quad\textrm{when both momenta are real}
\end{equation*}
The spinor products are antisymmetric and the product of an angle and an square spinors vanishes. 
With this remark and a slight abuse of notation, one has, from the completeness relation of spinors,
\begin{equation*}
\slashed{p} = |p\rangle [p| + |p]\langle p|
\end{equation*}
For computational purpose, we give here two useful identities
\begin{enumerate}
\item (Fierz) $\langle 1 |\gamma^\mu |2]\langle 3 |\gamma^\mu|4] = 2\langle 13 \rangle [24]$
\item (Schouten) $\langle ij \rangle \langle lk \rangle + \langle ik\rangle \langle jl\rangle + \langle il \rangle \langle kj \rangle$
\end{enumerate}
For the first one, the properties of the Pauli matrices are used and the second one can be derived from the fact that the spinors used here are two-dimensional objects.
