\section{Spinor-helicity formalism}
The spinor-helicity formalism is widely used in amplitude literatures. 
One can refer to~\cite{Dixon:1996wi,Elvang:2013cua} for good introductions\footnote{The convention may change according to the signature}.
We present some useful properties under the convention used in QCD~\cite{Dixon:1996wi}.
